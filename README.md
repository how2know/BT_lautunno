This project is currently in progress.
## Context and motivation
The development of medical devices, including all performed testing, must be documented according to standards that describe the processes of usability engineering. Writing this documentation is often a long and repetitive task. Therefore, I will develop a software that generates documents automatically as part of my Bachelor thesis.
## Task description
The goal of the project is to create a software that generates automatically the documentation of usability testing of medical devices with eye tracking. The program will be able to generate a docx file from the analyzed data of eye tracking studies. The generated documents will include all relevant information and data visualization according to standards of usability engineering.
