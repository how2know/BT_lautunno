The .tsv files containing the Tobii data must be saved in this folder.

If one wants to export one file for each participant, the files must be named “Participant” and end with the participant number, e.g. "Participant4.tsv". 
If one wants to export only one file that contains the data off all participants, it must be named "All_participants.tsv".
